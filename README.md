## Web Wallet
For the Web Wallet see; https://github.com/blocktrail/blocktrail-webwallet

## Install
```
npm install -g npm # make sure npm is latest version

# engine_strict=false is required because cordova -> cordova-common -> plist -> xmlbuilder@2.2.1
# next version of plist will use xmlbuilder@3.x which will fix this isse
npm_config_engine_strict=false npm install -g ionic@4.3.1 cordova@8.1.2 gulp

git submodule update --init --recursive # for translations package
cp appconfig.example.json appconfig.json

gulp
```

## Run
```
ionic cordova run android|ios
```

## Translations
Translations for both Web and Mobile Wallet are kept in: https://github.com/blocktrail/blocktrail-wallet-translations  
And then submoduled into the projects.  

Keep this in mind when adding / updating translations, don't forget to commit them to the translations repo.  

It's okay to do PRs without bumping the translations submodule, we'll handle that before doing releases!

## Release Process
### Use production config
```
mv appconfig.json .appconfig.json
cp appconfig.prod.json appconfig.json
```

### Bump Version
edit `config.xml` and bump the version

### Ionic prepare
run `ionic cordova prepare` for the version update to take effect and `git commit` any and all changes with "vX.Y.Z".  
tag the release as well in git at this point.

### Push to SentryIO
push the source files to sentryIO, make sure to pass it the right versionnumber and do this on BOTH platforms!
```
node pushsentryio.js <Android|iOS> <VERSIONNUMBER>
```

### Android
```
mv appconfig.json .appconfig.json
cp appconfig.prod.json appconfig.json

rm -rf platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/* # clean up old builds

ionic cordova build android --release 

jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore ~/keys/blocktrail.keystore /work/blocktrail-wallet/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-release-unsigned.apk blocktrail

```

### iOS
```
mv appconfig.json .appconfig.json
cp appconfig.prod.json appconfig.json

In xCode:
 - Select "Generic iOS Device" as build target (instead of emulator or connected phone)

### tips to remember
Remember to remove the old signed, zipped APK before running zipalign, it doesn't overwrite the file.
