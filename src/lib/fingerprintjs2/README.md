Original fingerprintjs library was developed in 2012, it's now impossible to evolve it
without breaking backwards compatibilty, so this project will be where
all the new development happens.

This project will use significantly more sources for fingerprinting, all
of them will be configurable, that is it should be possible to
cherry-pick only the options you need or just enable them all.

I'm also paying special attention to IE plugins, popular in China, such
as QQ, Baidu and others.

This project will not be backwards compatible with original
fingerprintjs.

This project uses `semver`.

### Installation

#### CDN:
```
//cdn.jsdelivr.net/fingerprintjs2/<VERSION>/fingerprint2.min.js
```
or

```
https://cdnjs.com/libraries/fingerprintjs2
```

#### Bower

```
bower install fingerprintjs2
```

#### NPM

```
npm install fingerprintjs2
```


### Usage

```js
new Fingerprint2().get(function(result, components){
  console.log(result); //a hash, representing your device fingerprint
  console.log(components); // an array of FP components
});
```

#### You can pass an object with options (all of which are optional):

```js
var options = {swfPath: '/assets/FontList.swf', excludeUserAgent: true};
new Fingerprint2(options).get(function(result){
  console.log(result);
});
```

Full list of options will be in the
(https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2/wiki/List-of-options) wiki
page.

Flash font enumeration is disabled by default. JS code is used by
default to get the list of available fonts.

The reason for this  is that Flash will not work in incognito mode.

However, you can make the library to use Flash when detecting the fonts
with:

```js
excludeJsFonts: true
```
option.

To use Flash font enumeration, make sure you have swfobject available.
If you don't, the library will skip the Flash part entirely.

#### `detectScreenOrientation` option is `true` by default

To ensure consistent fingerprints when users rotate their mobile
devices.


##### All fingerprinting sources are enabled by default, i.e. you don't need to explicitly configure the library to include them.

```js
new Fingerprint2().get(function(result, components){
  // this will use all available fingerprinting sources
  console.log(result);
  // components is an array of all fingerprinting components used
  console.log(components);
});
```

#### `userDefinedFonts` option

While hundreds of the most popular fonts are included in the extended font list, you may wish to increase the entropy of the font fingerprint by specifying the `userDefinedFonts` option as an array of font names.

```
new Fingerprint2({
  userDefinedFonts: ["Nimbus Mono", "Junicode", "Presto"]
}).get(function(result, components){}
  console.log(result);
);
```

#### View the fingerprint locally

You can view your browser fingerprint locally by starting a webserver and viewing the `index.html` page.
Loading `index.html` from the filesystem won't work due to Flash's ExternalInterface security restrictions.

To start a web server you can try using one of the following:

* Ruby 1.9.2+

    `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8080`

* Python 2.x

	`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

* Python 3.x

	`python -m http.server 8080`

* PHP 5.4+

	`php -S 0.0.0.0:8080`


### List of fingerprinting sources

1. UserAgent
2. Language
3. Color Depth
4. Screen Resolution
5. Timezone
6. Has session storage or not
7. Has local storage or not
8. Has indexed DB
9. Has IE specific 'AddBehavior'
10. Has open DB
11. CPU class
12. Platform
13. DoNotTrack or not
14. Full list of installed fonts (maintaining their order, which increases the entropy), implemented with Flash.
15. A list of installed fonts, detected with JS/CSS (side-channel technique) - can detect up to 500 installed fonts without flash
16. Canvas fingerprinting
17. WebGL fingerprinting
18. Plugins (IE included)
19. Is AdBlock installed or not
20. Has the user tampered with its languages <sup>[1](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2/wiki/Browser-tampering)</sup>
21. Has the user tampered with its screen resolution <sup>[1](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2/wiki/Browser-tampering)</sup>
22. Has the user tampered with its OS <sup>[1](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2/wiki/Browser-tampering)</sup>
23. Has the user tampered with its browser <sup>[1](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2/wiki/Browser-tampering)</sup>
24. Touch screen detection and capabilities
25. Pixel Ratio
26. System's total number of logical processors available to the user agent.


By default, JS font detection will only detect up to 65 installed fonts. If you want to improve the font detection,
you can pass `extendedJsFonts: true` option. This will increase the number of detectable fonts to ~500.

On my machine (MBP 2013 Core i5) + Chrome 46 the default FP process takes about 80-100ms. If you use `extendedJsFonts` option this time will increase up to 160-200ms.
This option can incur even more overhead on mobile Firefox browsers, which is much slower in font detection, so use it with caution on mobile devices.

### Many more fingerprinting sources will be implemented, such as
(in no particular order)

* Multi-monitor detection,
* Internal HashTable implementation detection
* WebRTC fingerprinting
* Math constants
* Accessibility fingerprinting
* Camera information
* DRM support
* Accelerometer support
* Virtual keyboards
* List of supported gestures (for touch-enabled devices)
* Pixel density
* Video and audio codecs availability
* Audio stack fingerprinting

#### To recompile the `FontList.swf` file:

* Download [Adobe Flex SDK](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html)
* Unzip it, add the `bin/` directory to your `$PATH`  (mxmlc binary should be in path)
* Run `make`
