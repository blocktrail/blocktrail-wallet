If your issue is about fingerprint changing fast/being inconsistent, please search for already closed issues about it, you may find your answer there.

This can be probably because of your browser upgrade (User agent string changing), different screen resolution on various devices (fixable by disabling screen_resolution option).

If you want to submit a bug, please let me know which browser/os you're using and which fingerprinting component is broken and/or different for you on multiple library calls.


If you want to ask a question - please use gitter.im (badge is in the readme) and ping me with @valve handle, I'll gladly answer specific questions about the library.
